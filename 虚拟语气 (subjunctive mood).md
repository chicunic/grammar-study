# 虚拟语气 (subjunctive mood)

虚拟语气是说话者表示愿望、假象或建议的一种动词形式。

## 意义

### 表示“有疑问的动作”

说话者不知道这个动作是否会发生，说话者认为这个动作仅仅是一种命令、要求、建议、猜想或意图。

- Most of them insisted that the proposal **be discussed** without delay.
- They suggested that Meg **should stay** with them for another week.

### 表示“非真实的动作”

说话者知道这个动作不会发生，说话者认为这个动作仅仅是一种主观愿望或假想。

- I wish that I **had** never **met** him.
- If I were a writer, I **should write** detective stories.

## 形式

1. 动词原形

## 虚拟语气用于条件状语从句

| 非真实条件句(非真实的动作) | 从句谓语                                                     | 主句谓语                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 与现在事实相反             | 过去式[2]                                                    | would (should / could / might) + 动词原形[6]        |
| 与过去事实相反             | had + 过去分词[3]                                            | would (should / could / might) + have + 过去分词[7] |
| 与将来事实相反             | 过去式[2]<br />should + 动词原形[4]<br />情态动词 were to + 动词原形 (表示可能性小) | would (should / could / might) + 动词原形[6]        |

条件状语从句通称为条件句；它可以分为两种：一种是**真实条件句**，一种是**非真实条件句**。

1. **真实条件句**所表示的假设是可能发生或实现的，从句和主句都使用直陈语气。由于这种条件句通常表将来，所以一般从句用现在时态，主句用将来时态。

- If I **have** enough money next year, I **will go** to Japan.
- If you **continue** in this way you'**ll break** your mother's heart.
- If you'**ve finished**, we'**ll go** and **have** coffee.
- Oil **floats** if you **pour** it on water. [表示现在]
- In the evenings we **played** chess or **strolled about** if it **was** fine. [表示过去]

2. **非真实条件句**所表示的假设是不可能或不大可能发生或实现的，即非真实的动作，从句和主句需使用虚拟语气。虚拟语气用于**与现在事实相反的条件句**时，从句谓语用过去式[2]，主句谓语用“should (第一人称) / would (第二/三人称) + 动词原形”[6]。

- I **should be** sorry if you **thought** ill **of** me.
- If we **left** now, we **should arrive** in good time.
- If I **were** you, I **would refuse** the money. [would 代替 should]

3. 虚拟语气用于**与过去事实相反的条件句**时，从句谓语用“ had + 过去分词”[3]，主句谓语用“should (第一人称) / would (第二/三人称) + have + 过去分词”[7]。

- The soup **would have been** better if it **had had** less salt.
- If they **hadn't gone on** vacation, their house **wouldn't have been broken into**.
- Why, I **shouldn't have found** you even now, if I **hadn't met** him in the street this morning.
- I **wouldn't have known** what these were for if I **hadn't been told**. [would 代替 should]

4. 在一些所谓分裂条件句中，主句和从句所表示的时间并不一致。有时主句表示现在，从句表示过去；有时主句表示过去，从句表示现在。

- If I **had spoken** to him yesterday, I **should know** what to do now.
- I think **we should have been told** if there **was** anything up.

   如果条件状语从句用 if I were … 时，主句则可以用任一时态的虚拟形式。

- If I **were** you, I **would go**.
- If I **hadn't been** busy, I **would have come**.

5. 虚拟语气用于**与将来事实相反的条件句**时，从句谓语用过去式[2]，主句谓语用“should (第一人称) / would (第二/三人称) + 动词原形”[6]。

- If I **made** a mistake, I **should try** to remedy it.
- If you **lived** there for a while, you'**d change** your mind about that place.
- If there **were** anything to tell, I **would tell** it to you.

   在这种表示将来的条件句中，也可以用“should + 动词原形”[4]。

- If he **should go** away, I **should be** grieved.
- If it **should rain** tomorrow, we **should have to put off** the match.
- If you **would be** interested, I **should be** very glad to send you a copy of my book. [用 would 代替 should，以避免与主句的 should 重复]

   在这种条件句中，谓语还可以用“情态动词 were to + 动词原形”。这种形式比较正式，多用于书面语中，其假象性很强，实现性甚小。

- If he **were to come**, what **should** we **say** to him?
- This **wouldn't look** well if relatives **were to call**.

6. 情态动词 could / might 也可用于非真实条件句。could / might 时虚拟形式，但保留了本身的情态含义。

   情态动词可以用于主句。

- If he **were** ready, he **might go** with us. [表示现在或将来]
- If he **had been** ready, he **might have gone** with us. [表示过去]

   情态动词可以用于从句。

- If I **could translate** this article without a dictionary, I **should get** my work done more quickly. [表示现在或将来]
- If I **could have translated** that article without a dictionary, I **should have got** my work done more quickly. [表示过去]

   有时情态动词可可以同时用于主句和从句。

- If you only **could have taught** me, I **could have learnt** from you.

   情态动词 would 也可用于非真实条件句，表意愿。

- If you **would lend** me the book, I **should read** it with pleasure.
